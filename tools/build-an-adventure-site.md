# Créez un lieu pour l'aventure

## Choisissez un thème
- Choisissez un thème pour la zone. Une mythologie spécifique qui vous inspire, un sujet historique, etc.
- Nom (doit refléter le thème). Il y a de très bons noms [ici](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/forest_names.php).
- Trouvez une prémisse d'aventure (par exemple, un lieu insolite avec un trésor à chercher).
- Décidez d'une faction dominante, avec ses caractéristiques et ses motivations.
- Ajoutez une sorte de contrepoids (une autre faction, un ennemi malfaisant, etc.).
- Gardez ces concepts à l'esprit à tout moment : Dangers, Enjeux, Motifs, Urgence. Plus vous pouvez en intégrer, mieux c'est.

## Spark Tables
[Spark Tables](https://www.bastionland.com/2017/11/electric-modernity-and-spark-tables.html) are very handy tools for quickly creating a setting. They are typically made of 40 words divided into two columns. For an example Spark Table see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b3E3FsQVvjqAMVcDIVXXQmo9g6bH0fQBDbzRJ6K5F10/edit#gid=0). With some light editing, it can result in phrases like:  
- Digesting Claws
- White Eyes
- Distorted Tongues
- Predatory Awakening
- Grimalkin Fungi
- Nourishing Deep
- Paranoia Underbrush
- Mouth-less Cemetery
- Withering Hue
- Subterranean Ripple
- Transmutation Sparrows
- Moonlight Trees
- Mildew Gloom
- Smoldering Shade

### Create Spark Tables
To create a Spark Table, you'll want to find a find a book or website close to your adventure's overall theme (e.g. a PDF with related content). You can pull words from it by simply picking a random page and writing down whatever meets your eye, or you can import it into a web-based tool. You can also import [public domain books](https://archive.org/details/texts) on relevant subjects. [WordCounter.net](https://wordcounter.net/website-word-count) can create lists of non-common keywords from a website. You can then copy and paste those words into a spreadsheet.

Alternatively, take a look at [TerriblyBeautiful](https://www.patreon.com/terriblybeautiful) by [Colin Kloeker](https://twitter.com/colinkloecker?lang=en). Basically, you join the Discord server (see Patreon link - it's free) and then run commands in the "bibliomancers-workshop" channel (see pinned).

When you've finished:  
- Clean up the words. Sort by d20 in two columns.
- You'll want to generate at least 10 interesting phrases for inspiration.
- You can of course simply write down 40 words that sound good together.
- Images can also serve as sparks.

## Draw A Map
- If you can draw, great! Otherwise, find a map-making tool that works for you. Examples are [draw.io](http://draw.io), [Hex Kit](https://coneofnegativeenergy.com/hex-kit/), [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.owlbear.rodeo/), [Wonderdraft](http://wonderdraft.net/), etc.
- Draw at least four lines of any shape, each from a different color. Each line should cross another at least once. These lines represent roads or paths.
- Generate at least 3 Points of Interest: take in consideration the theme(s) and factions. Put these wherever the lines cross.
- Generate regional/hex features for each POI using tables and placing results in those POIs where it makes most sense.
- Place additional (especially hidden) dangers, encounters or NPC’s in some of the POI.
- Add some travel/route complications, taking in consideration any POIs along the way.

## Create Encounters
- Encounter table (either 1d6 or 2d6), with at least one result tied to the party or its members.
- Details on any treasure or relics (Who wants it? Where is it now? Why wasn't it ransacked before?). Include maps.
- Describe rooms for a dungeon (one sentence describing obstacles, hazards, creatures or minor treasure).

You do not need to do this for ever single POI, only those that interest you.

## Create Treasure:
- Look on the map and think of who would want treasure, and what kind.
- Look on the map and think of where that treasure could be now.
- Add 2-3 steps leading up to the location of the treasure, but don't be too obvious.
- Add some sort of "dungeon" in the place where the treasure resides.
- Stock "rooms" of a dungeon (additional treasure goes here)
- [Maze Rats](https://questingbeast.itch.io/maze-rats) has incredible treasure and "loot the body" tables. You can find an automated version in the [Adventuresmith](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.steavesea.adventuresmith&hl=en_US&gl=US) app.
